# Offline Text Editor

## Description

This is an example of a Progressive Web Application that uses multiple data persistence techniques that serve as redundancies in case one fails.

I created this project to prove my knowledge of javascript, webpack, as well as file structure and all the necessary connections.

It works by creating a bundled PWA when running "npm run build" from the root folder. The created PWA works by indexing all content the user types whenever the user focuses away, as well as relying on a service worker for added rigidity.
